Hey, how are you doing?

Welcome to our official company repository. This is were our heart lies. Whatever we do, whoever we are, wherever we stand, all the progress we have made is all possible beacuse we were able to communicate our craft for engineering via code.

Since code is of such an importance, we believe keeping it healty is equally important. Things like readibility, documentation, structure & organization are equally imporant as the algo that powers it. We have dedicated documents that you can refer through for help. 

If you reading this & aren't a part of the team, chances are you are curious as hell! Why not channel that curiousity towards something greater & join the lean team that makes it all happen? Shoot us an email & we will get to you. Godspeed!
